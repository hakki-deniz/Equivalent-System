    This script is a representative of "three-point Gauss-Legendre" model.

    The code creates a cantilever column model with four rigid elements and
    three zeroLength elements.

    The flexural rigidity of the zeroLength elements that gives the correct
    lateral displacement, are calculated via "virtual work method".
